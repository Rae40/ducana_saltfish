          Ducana and Saltfish can be eaten at any time of year but is mostly eaten together on Good Friday. Antiguans and Barbudans practise not eating anything containing blood (meat) on this day in honor of Jesus shedding his blood and dying for us on the cross. It's a savory dish, but also salty because of the saltfish and is usually paired with chop-up. Chop-up is a mix of greens such as spinach, okra, eggplant etc.

            Growing up, Seagrape leaves were growing in my yard and that's what my mother uses to prepare the sweet potato mixture in before boiling them in water. However, other than seagrape leaves, banana leaves or foil can also be used as a substitute. (I perfer the leaves over foil for added taste but I'll eat them regardless because its still delicious.)

          Saltfish is eaten often because of availabilty and as a meat substitute. It can be sauteed in tomato sauce and onios after being boiled and/or turned into a fritter or a ball with flour and seasonings.

           <h3>Ducana</h3> 

          Ingredients:

          <li>2 cups grated coconut* </li>

           <li>2 cups grated sweet potatoes (Boniato variety) </li>

          <li>2 cups of sugar </li>

          <li> 1 tsp cinnamon</li>

          <li> 1 tsp grated nutmeg</li>

          <li>1 tbsp of vanilla extract </li>

          <li>1 cup of raisins (optional) </li>

          <li>1 ½ cups of flour </li>
          </ul>

          <ul id="directions">
           <span id="orange">Directions:</span> 

    <li>Grate coconut and sweet potatoes in a blender.  You will need some liquid to help the grating process, either use the coconut water, milk or just water,  but no more than 1 1/2  cup of liquid.
    <li>Mix all the ingredients in a bowl in the order they appear in the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cut 10×12 pieces of foil paper to wrap the ducana.</li>
    <li>Use a ladle or large spoon to scoop the batter into the center of the foil then fold the foil 2/3 of the way, covering the mixture.</li>
    <li>Fold the batter and foil once more (or twice depending on the size of batter you scooped out)  making sure to keep the ends pinned so the batter doesn’t ooze out either side.  The foil and batter should look like a flattened cylinder.</li>
    <li>Fold in/ roll up  each end of the foil to seal in the batter.</li>
    <li>Place ducana in boiling water and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove them from the water and let them cool for 10 minutes before opening them.</li>

          </ul>

            You’re done.

  Serve with fresh steamed spinach seasoned with salt to taste. (Do Not Boil Fresh Spinach) You can use eggplant mix with the spinach and/or long squash. 
<br />
  In Antigua it’s called chop up. As the photo shows, I have pieces of pumpkins. You can also put it beside some boiled okras.
</p>
<p>
<br />  TIPS: * You can also use grated pumpkins along with the sweet potatoes and coconut; it gives your ducana a smooth texture also a different color, a yellowish grey.
<br />
Happy Easter!
